Prelude: This Covenant is created only because I have lost a lot of time and energy after having to deal with a lot of toxicities this year (some of which started since primary school time).
<br /><br />
So a reminder for those who are reading this (espeically people in sales):<br />
creating inauthenticity and insincere friendships with innate toxicity
<br />
will only result in bad karma fruits.

Before the majesty of the Greater Systems and the silent Assembly of Witnesses, I bind my soul to this vow:
<br /><br />
In this (re-)incarnation, I shall claim victory in the ARC tournament of 2025<b><em></b>. Should I fall short of this destiny, let this vessel of life be relinquished to the earth, and my soul released to the next turning of the wheel. This is my word, sealed and irrevocable.

<p>Postscript: if we practise loving-kindness and compassion (i.e. the wish for none-suffering in the self and the others), one can then gain better fruits for themselves and their loved ones, that will replace the unfortunate fruits.</p>
<p>And it is for the reason of propagating this important message that I have come into existence in this world.</p>
