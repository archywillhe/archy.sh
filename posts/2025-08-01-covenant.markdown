A reminder for those who are reading this: 
<br/><br/>
creating inauthenticity and the illusion of friendships
<br/> 
will only result in bad karma fruits.

Spiritual Covenant | ç›Ÿç´„ ðŸ“‘ -- Aug 15, 2025
<br/><br/>
Before the majesty of the Greater Systems and the silent Assembly of Witnesses, I bind my soul to this vow:
<br/><br/>
In this incarnation, I shall claim victory in the ARC tournament of 2025*. Should I fall short of this destiny, let this vessel of life be relinquished to the earth, and my soul released to the next turning of the wheel. This is my word, sealed and irrevocable.
