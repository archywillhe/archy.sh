title: "Spiritual Covenant (with added Prelude)"
---

<br/><br/>
<small>
Prelude: This Covenant is created because I have lost a lot of time and energy after having to deal with a lot of toxicities this year (some of which started since primary school time).
<br/><br/>
So a reminder for those who are reading this (espeically people in sales):<br/>
creating inauthenticity and insincere friendships with innate toxicity
<br/>
will only result in bad karma fruits.

<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
Before the majesty of the Greater Systems and the silent Assembly of Witnesses, I bind my soul to this vow:
<br/><br/>
In this incarnation, I shall claim victory in the ARC tournament of 2025<b>*</b>. Should I fall short of this destiny, let this vessel of life be relinquished to the earth, and my soul released to the next turning of the wheel. This is my word, sealed and irrevocable.
