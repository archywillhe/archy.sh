If, at the time of my death, the 11.market foundation is no longer in existence or is unable to accept this bequest, I direct that the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate be given to a similar organization or foundation whose primary mission is to promote the development of arts and open-source softwares through monetary prize incentives, particularly those implemented in novel or specialized programming languages.
