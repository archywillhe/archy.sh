<p>I, Archy Will He 何魏奇 (He, Weiqi), being of sound mind and disposing memory, do hereby declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, hereby revoking all prior wills and codicils made by me.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><u>Charitable Bequest to the 11.market Foundation*</u></p>
<p>I give, devise, and bequeath all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, of whatsoever kind and wheresoever situated, to the foundation known as 11.market (or its legal successor), to be used exclusively for the purpose of funding monetary prizes and awards for interactive arts and open-source softwares, libraries, and frameworks implemented in the programming language lo.fish**, in accordance with the foundation’s established procedures.</p>
<p>If, at the time of my death, the 11.market foundation is no longer in existence or is unable to accept this bequest, I direct that the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate be given to a similar organization or foundation whose primary mission is to promote the development of arts and open-source softwares through monetary prize incentives, particularly those implemented in novel or specialized programming languages.</p>
<p>I direct my Executor to take all necessary steps to ensure that this bequest is carried out in accordance with my intentions as stated herein.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of August, in the year of twenty hundred and twenty-five CE.</p>
<p>Archy Will He 何魏奇, Testator</p>
